# üîê Security Lab ‚Äî Cryptography Demos in C++

A collection of educational C++ programs demonstrating classical and modern cryptographic algorithms for learning and experimentation.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Educational purposes only!** These implementations use simplified math and are not suitable for production use. Always use established cryptographic libraries (OpenSSL, libsodium, Botan) for real-world security.

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains hands-on implementations of cryptographic primitives, organized into three categories:

**Classical Ciphers** ‚Äî Historical encryption techniques  
**Public-Key Cryptography** ‚Äî RSA and ElGamal systems  
**Modern Cryptography** ‚Äî Elliptic curve implementations

All programs are written in modern C++ with inline comments explaining the mathematics and algorithms.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
- C++ compiler with C++11 or later (g++, clang++)
- Basic familiarity with modular arithmetic

**Clone and build:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sajib1472/Security-Lab.git
cd Security-Lab

# Compile a single program
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 Caesar_cipher.cpp -o caesar
./caesar

# Or compile all programs at once
mkdir -p bin
for f in *.cpp; do 
  g++ -std=c++17 -O2 "$f" -o "bin/$(basename "$f" .cpp)"
done
```

---

## üî® Build & Run

### Single Program

```bash
# Compile and run Caesar cipher
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 Caesar_cipher.cpp -o caesar
./caesar
```

### Batch Compilation

```bash
# Compile all programs into bin/ directory
mkdir -p bin
for f in *.cpp; do 
  echo "Compiling $f..."
  g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -O2 "$f" -o "bin/$(basename "$f" .cpp)" || break
done

# List compiled programs
ls -lh bin/
```

### Makefile (Optional)

Create a `Makefile` for easier builds:

```makefile
CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++17 -Wall -O2
BINDIR = bin
SOURCES = $(wildcard *.cpp)
TARGETS = $(patsubst %.cpp,$(BINDIR)/%,$(SOURCES))

all: $(BINDIR) $(TARGETS)

$(BINDIR):
	mkdir -p $(BINDIR)

$(BINDIR)/%: %.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $< -o $@

clean:
	rm -rf $(BINDIR)

.PHONY: all clean
```

Then simply run `make` to build everything or `make clean` to remove binaries.

## üí° Usage Examples

### Caesar Cipher
```bash
./bin/Caesar_cipher
# Input: HELLO
# Key: 3
# Output: KHOOR
```

### RSA Encryption
```bash
./bin/RSA_encryption
# The program demonstrates:
# - Prime selection (p, q)
# - Public/private key generation (e, d, n)
# - Encryption: c = m^e mod n
# - Decryption: m = c^d mod n
```

### ElGamal Encryption
```bash
./bin/Elgamal_encryption
# Demonstrates:
# - Generator selection for prime p
# - Key generation (public h, private x)
# - Random k selection
# - Encryption: (c1, c2) pair
# - Decryption using discrete log
```

### Transpose Cipher
```bash
./bin/transpose_cipher
# Input: "HELLO WORLD"
# Key (columns): 4
# Creates matrix and reads column-wise
```

### Vernam Cipher (One-Time Pad)
```bash
./bin/Verman_cipher
# XORs plaintext with key
# Outputs in hexadecimal
# Perfect secrecy when key is truly random
```

### Elliptic Curve
```bash
./bin/Elliptic_curve_encryption
# Demonstrates:
# - Point arithmetic (add, double, multiply)
# - Base point selection
# - EC-ElGamal encryption/decryption
```

## üîí Security Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Educational Use Only

These implementations are **NOT secure** for production use because:

1. **Small Parameters** ‚Äî Uses small primes/keys that can be easily factored or brute-forced
2. **Naive Integer Math** ‚Äî No big-integer library; prone to overflow and side-channel attacks
3. **Weak Randomness** ‚Äî Uses `rand()` instead of cryptographically secure RNGs
4. **No Padding** ‚Äî Missing OAEP, PSS, or other padding schemes required for real RSA
5. **Timing Attacks** ‚Äî Not constant-time; vulnerable to timing side channels
6. **No Input Validation** ‚Äî Minimal error checking and sanitization

### ‚úÖ For Real Cryptography, Use:

- **OpenSSL** ‚Äî Industry standard, widely audited
- **libsodium** ‚Äî Modern, easy-to-use, misuse-resistant
- **Botan** ‚Äî C++ cryptographic library
- **BoringSSL** ‚Äî Google's fork of OpenSSL
- **Crypto++** ‚Äî C++ class library of cryptographic schemes

### üìñ Learning Path

1. Start with classical ciphers (Caesar, Vigen√®re, Vernam)
2. Understand modular arithmetic (RSA examples)
3. Study discrete logarithm problem (ElGamal)
4. Explore elliptic curves (modern crypto foundation)
5. Read *Applied Cryptography* by Bruce Schneier and *Cryptography Engineering*

## üêõ Known Issues & Improvements

### Current Limitations

| Issue | Impact | Suggested Fix |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **No input validation** | Empty keys, invalid inputs crash programs | Add checks for empty strings, numeric validation |
| **`ctype` on signed char** | Undefined behavior on some platforms | Cast to `unsigned char` before calling `isalpha()`, etc. |
| **Native int overflow** | RSA/ElGamal fail with realistic key sizes | Use GMP or Boost.Multiprecision |
| **Weak randomness** | Predictable `k` values in ElGamal/signatures | Use `std::random_device` + platform secure RNG |
| **VLA usage** | Non-portable C++ (some files) | Replace with `std::vector` (already done in `transpose_cipher.cpp`) |
| **No constant-time ops** | Vulnerable to timing attacks | Implement constant-time comparison/exponentiation |

### Roadmap for Improvements

- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation to all programs
- [ ] Integrate GMP library for big-integer support
- [ ] Add unit tests with known test vectors
- [ ] Implement constant-time utilities
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI for automatic compilation
- [ ] Create interactive demo mode with pre-loaded examples

## üì§ Git Workflow

### Push Only Source Files

To avoid committing binaries and build artifacts:

**1. Create `.gitignore`:**

```bash
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
# Compiled binaries
bin/
*.out
*.exe
*.o
*.obj
a.out

# macOS
.DS_Store
.AppleDouble
.LSOverride

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
*~

# Build artifacts
build/
cmake-build-*/
EOF
```

**2. Stage and commit source files:**

```bash
# Add only C++ source files and documentation
git add *.cpp *.h README.md .gitignore

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add cryptography demos with documentation"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin main
```

### Remove Already-Committed Binaries

If you accidentally committed binaries:

```bash
# Remove from tracking but keep local copies
git rm --cached bin/*
git rm --cached *.out

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove compiled binaries from tracking"

# Push changes
git push
```

### Clean Git History (Advanced)

To completely remove large files from history:

```bash
# Install git-filter-repo (recommended over filter-branch)
brew install git-filter-repo  # macOS
# or: pip install git-filter-repo

# Backup your repo first!
cp -r ../Security-Lab ../Security-Lab-backup

# Remove all files in bin/ from history
git filter-repo --path bin/ --invert-paths

# Force push (only if you're sure!)
git push origin --force --all
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** History rewriting affects all collaborators. Coordinate with your team first!
