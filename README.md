# üîê Security Lab ‚Äî Cryptography Demos in C++

A collection of educational C++ programs demonstrating classical and modern cryptographic algorithms for learning and experimentation.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Educational purposes only!** These implementations use simplified math and are not suitable for production use. Always use established cryptographic libraries (OpenSSL, libsodium, Botan) for real-world security.

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains hands-on implementations of cryptographic primitives, organized into three categories:

**Classical Ciphers** ‚Äî Historical encryption techniques  
**Public-Key Cryptography** ‚Äî RSA and ElGamal systems  
**Modern Cryptography** ‚Äî Elliptic curve implementations

All programs are written in modern C++ with inline comments explaining the mathematics and algorithms.
